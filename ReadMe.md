This project is a **NodeJS** server and a bunch of Python scripts designed to demonstrate an concurrency problem with global variables.

###Setup

+ `npm install` should get your node server up and running. Then use `node server.js` to start the node server.
+ Execute `python3 main.py` (assuming that you're running both variants on your computer)
